      <h1>Fun facts about React</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed by Facebook: React was developed by Facebook's engineering
          team. It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and on
          Instagram in 2012.
        </li>

        <li>
          Declarative Syntax: React uses a declarative syntax which makes it
          easier to understand and debug compared to traditional JavaScript
          frameworks.
        </li>

        <li>
          Component-Based Architecture: React is based on a component-based
          architecture, where UIs are broken down into independent, reusable
          pieces. This makes it easy to manage complex UIs.
        </li>

        <li>
          Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM which is a lightweight copy of
          the actual DOM. It helps to improve performance by reducing the number
          of updates needed.
        </li>

        <li>
          JSX: React uses a syntax extension called JSX which allows you to
          write HTML elements in your JavaScript code. This makes it more
          readable and convenient for developers.
        </li>

        <li>
          One-Way Data Binding: React follows a unidirectional data flow. This
          means data in a React application flows in a single direction, which
          makes it easier to debug and understand the state of your application.
        </li>

        <li>
          React Native: React can be used to build native mobile applications
          for iOS and Android. React Native allows developers to use the same
          React components and concepts for building mobile apps.
        </li>

        <li>
          Large Community and Ecosystem: React has a vast community and a rich
          ecosystem of libraries and tools. This makes it easy to find solutions
          to problems and accelerates development.
        </li>

        <li>
          Backed by Facebook and Instagram: Being developed and maintained by
          Facebook and Instagram, React is constantly updated and improved by
          some of the best developers in the industry.
        </li>

        <li>
          Open Source: React is an open-source library, which means it's free to
          use and can be modified by anyone. This has contributed to its
          popularity and widespread adoption.
        </li>

        <li>
          Netflix, Airbnb, and Instagram Use React: Some of the biggest tech
          companies like Netflix, Airbnb, and Instagram use React in their
          applications, which speaks to its scalability and reliability.
        </li>

        <li>
          Highly Performant: Thanks to its virtual DOM and efficient rendering,
          React is known for its high performance, even in applications with a
          large number of components.
        </li>
